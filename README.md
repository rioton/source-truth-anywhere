# source-truth-anywhere
Linking source of truth from anywhere in software engineering

We're in micro working era, every body needs to work remotely with others, sometimes WFH. We need to use a lot software tools to collabrate, keeping a consitent interface to get the source-of-truth is vital for this environment.

For example, we can discuss customer requirements in Slack, and put the doc in confluence. Then the doc will be linked to Jira as requirements, next it will be exported to qTest as requirements, and corresponding test suite will be built based on the it. In this case, requirement doc becomes the source-of-truth, shared and linked by other tools.

This project is to provide a viable solution like defining a set of RESTful API to simplifying this process issue.
